### Problem Summary:
We would like to predict an apartment's rental price in Toronto by knowing the businesses around it. Specifically, we would like to explore what effect businesses have on nearby apartment prices, and to try and determine the trends that lead to more expensive or desirable living space. If we know that certain businesses impact the price of an apartment when they open nearby, we can locate businesses that are more valuable to people. It can help land developers and business owners better forecast how new businesses can impact apartment rental prices in neighborhoods.
